//Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//let car = 'subaru';
//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//console.log(car == 'subaru')
//• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
//• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
//Making a varaible
let Five = 5;

//Test 1
console.log(`test 1: five is equal to 5?`);

//Test 2
console.log(`\ntest 2: ten is equal 10?`);
console.log(Ten == 10);
//Test 3
console.log(`\ntest 3: 5 is not equal to 10`);
console.log(Five != Ten);
//Test 4
console.log(`\ntest 4: 10 is greater than to 5`);

//Test 5

//Test 6
