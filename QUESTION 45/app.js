//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
//Creat a function:
function CreateCar(Manufacture, Model_Name, Optional) {
    return Object.assign({ Manufacture,
        Model_Name }, Optional);
}
const MyCar = CreateCar("Toyota", "Corolla", { color: "Black", year: "2024" });
//Print :
console.log(MyCar);
